Q3. How to combine two commits into one commit?
Ans : 
    In Git you can merge several commits into one with the powerful interactive rebase. It's a handy tool I use quite often; I usually tidy up my working space by grouping together several small intermediate commits into a single lump to push upstream.
    To combine 2 commits i.e. C2 and C3 we uses git rebase --interactive HEAD~[N] where N is the number of commits we want to combine. So in our case N = 2 and HEAD must be on C2 for combining 2 commits.
    
    alternative if you want to squash everyting in feature branch into master you could just do the following things.
    
    step 1 : git checkout master
    step 2 : git merge --squash feature_branch_name
    step 3 : git
